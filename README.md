# Clean Water Mapping (SpaceApps 2015)

## Challenge description

Consider creating an app that is accessible to technical users (managers and technicians of organized rural aqueducts) and non-technical users (individuals or support staff of community systems for water provision).

Your app should aim to assess drinking water sources. These include: individual/communal household wells; water takes from surface streams that are piped across the landscape to be distributed to several households; or specific access points (where the water source location is distant from the user's location).

Your app could identify water availability from the identified source, and the water requirement for those who use this water source. This will help to identify areas vulnerable to water stress. The flow and number of users can be highly variable, in particular groundwater use and availability is widely unknown.

You may want to crowd-source information about issues that affect access to the local water sources. Access limitations can include: yearly dry-season length; frequency of drought spells; heavy precipitation events damaging infrastructure or affecting water quality (sediments). Other hazards include point (industrial or households sources) or diffuse (agriculture with intense chemical inputs) contaminant sources. Spatial and temporal monitoring and mapping of these issues is an urgent need.

The challenge is to improve mapping of drinking water resources. This could include development of a crowdsourcing app to monitor and map: potable water availability (well/stream/reservoir levels as measured by local people/ organizations), water quality, contaminants and ground water. This can help with identification of priority areas experiencing water stress (spatially and temporally) and contribute to improved access to drinking water. Along with available soil, weather and climate data, this could feed into early warning systems for regions that are under water stress.
